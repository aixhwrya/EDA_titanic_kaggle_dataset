# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A detailed exploratory data analysis of the famous Titanic dataset to understand survival trends based on demographic and socioeconomic factors.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `titanic_eda.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing the complete EDA, visualizations, and analysis.
- No external dataset files required — uses Seaborn's built-in Titanic dataset.

---

## 📊 Objectives

- Perform in-depth EDA to uncover trends in survival.
- Visualize relationships between variables (gender, age, class, etc.).
- Handle missing values and detect outliers.
- Draw actionable insights for future predictive modeling.

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Females and children had significantly higher survival rates.
- 1st-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Higher fares correlated positively with survival.
- Embarkation port and family size also influenced outcomes.

## ✅ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)
